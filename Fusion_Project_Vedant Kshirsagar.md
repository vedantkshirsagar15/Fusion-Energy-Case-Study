**<u>MARKET ANALYSIS FOR NUCLEAR FUSION IN INDIA</u>**

> **<u>Nuclear Fusion and Di erent Ways to Generate Fusion</u>**

The fusion process can only occur under speciﬁc conditions. Atoms must
be subjected to immense heat and pressure to overcome tremendous
physical forces and fuse. There are three methods most likely to yield
sustained fusion reactions on Earth, with one beyond our reach.

> **<u>Magnets</u>** - The leading global approach is conﬁning fusion
> fuel with magnetic ﬁelds, called magnetic conﬁnement fusion. In the
> process, fuel becomes so hot that electrons break o , and nuclei smash
> together to fuse. Matter at these extreme conditions is called
> plasma.All sorts of devices use strong magnetic ﬁelds to shape, heat,
> and conﬁne the plasma. Among them are tokamaks, stellarators,
> spheromaks, compact tori such as the ﬁeld-reversed conﬁguration (FRC),
> mirror machines, and several other magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Since
> the plasma in these fusion devices is hotter than our sun’s core,
> magnetic ﬁelds control the shape and direction of the plasma, ensuring
> the device’s walls are not damaged. The central solenoid magnet at
> ITER will be the largest pulsed electromagnet globally and capable of
> lifting a 100,000-ton aircraft carrier straight out of the water!
>
> **<u>Lasers</u>** - Another approach to fusion is targeting a
> grain-sized capsule of atoms with colossal lasers, sparking
> instantaneous bursts of energy. This process is known as inertial
> conﬁnement fusion, most notably done at the U.S. National Ignition
> Facility (NIF).The size of three football stadiums, NIF is the most
> precise and reproducible laser system globally. NIF precisely guides,
> ampliﬁes, reﬂects, and focuses 192 powerful laser beams into a target
> about the size of a pencil eraser in a few billionths of a second,
> delivering more than 2 million joules of ultraviolet energy and 500
> trillion watts of peak power. The lasers strike the capsule from all
> angles, dramatically compressing the capsule to a state where fusion
> occurs. The operation is similar to squeezing a basketball to the size
> of a pea.
>
> **<u>Volts, accelerators and</u>** **<u>pistons</u>** - Somewhere
> between the long-lived plasmas held by magnets and the instantaneous
> bursts of energy created by lasers, scientists have demonstrated
> several ways to produce pulses of fusion lasting a few fractions of a
> second. Applying an array of di erent engineering approaches, one of
> these designs could result in a fusion device that’s able more energy
> than it consumes.One technique involves using the self-generated
> magnetic ﬁeld created by strong electrical current, known as a Z
> pinch, instead of external magnets. Another uses particle accelerator
> technology to collide bundles of plasma. A third involves powerful
> pistons that attempt to physically compress plasma to fusion
> conditions. It’s possible the ﬁrst commercial fusion system will
> involve a combination of the many methods currently being tested.
>
> **<u>Gravity</u>** - The one genuinely successful approach to fusion
> energy thus far is unavailable to us on Earth. The sun and stars take
> advantage of their behemoth weight
>
> to crush hydrogen at the core, fusing into helium via tremendous
> force. With no such Earthly equivalent, scientists have to keep trying
> with magnets, lasers, and other viable methods, to perform star power.

>
> Replace fossil fuels: Use fusion-generated electricity to **replace**
